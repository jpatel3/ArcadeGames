## 🎲 How to Play

1. Enter player names and choose unique tokens
2. Take turns rolling the dice to move along the path
3. Watch out for "Dino Roar" spaces (5, 10, 15, and 20) - when a player lands on these, the T-Rex moves 3 spaces closer!
4. The T-Rex starts 10 spaces behind the Jungle (at position -10)
5. If the T-Rex catches up to a player, that player is out of the game
6. The first player to reach the Safe Cave (space 20) wins the game
7. If all players get caught by the T-Rex, everyone loses!
